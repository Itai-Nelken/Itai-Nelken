**Itai-Nelken/Itai-Nelken** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a lot of rpi projects, mainly on creating a [guide](https://bit.ly/ubuntu-pi-fixes) for                           Ubuntu on RPi with fixes and apps that need a bit of tinkering to get working. and on [compiling Etcher for armhf/arm64](https://github.com/Itai-Nelken/Etcher-arm-32-64) each time a new version is out for [pi-apps](https://github.com/botspot/pi-apps/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning shell script and python
