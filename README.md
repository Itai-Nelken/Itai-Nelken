### Hi there 👋 I'm an RPi hobbyist that is learning to code.

<!--
**Itai-Nelken/Itai-Nelken** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- 🔭 I’m currently working on random RPI projects, mainly on creating a [guide](https://bit.ly/ubuntu-pi-fixes) for                           Ubuntu on RPi with fixes and apps that need a bit of tinkering to get working. and on [compiling Etcher for armhf/arm64](https://github.com/Itai-Nelken/Etcher-arm-32-64) each time a new version is out for [pi-apps](https://github.com/botspot/pi-apps/).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning shell script and python
- 💬 Ask me about anything RPi related.
